In order to maintain the pixel size of the grid container (1000x1000), while increasing or decreasing the number of cells, the cells need to expand and contract.

I'm thinking I can create a regular 16x16 grid first, and plug all that in hard code. For the JS interaction after the button press: 
- I can fade out the grid container 
- destroy the nodes 
- create new nodes 
- add those to the grid container
- change the grid template columns (and rows?)
- then fade it all in?
