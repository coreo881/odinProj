Lessons learned:

- CSS variables are very handy
- You can plug in two css variables into calc and compute a value. I've only used calc on two values or one value and variable, so it made sense that I could put two variables in there.  I was right.
- I knew a lot about CSS Grid already, but changing them via JS and CSS variable is a breeze. A dream? A breezy dream.

Things to add when I revisit this:

- Add a shake to clear on the mobile version
-
