Lessons learned:

- A whole lot about event listeners
  - You can't remove an anonymous event listener without doing some serious code gymnastics.
  - The difference between using "handler" in a callback function vs using "handler()". The latter calls the function immediately.
  - Cloning a node and replacing it to remove all event listeners

Things to add when I revisit this:

- A replay button. Right now you have to reload the page.
- A more robust log. It's a little dry at the moment.
- I could play with colors a little more.
